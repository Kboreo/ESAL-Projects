* Documentation on the hardware can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5dyCPYc4bVjbDVFS1dXS1EyU1E)  
* Labs and instructions can be found in [./Labs](/Labs)     
* A c project template can be found in [./c_template](/c_template)    
* A project template with driver libraries can be found in [./project_template](/project_template)   
* Code snippets from class or lab will be uploaded to [./snippets](/snippets)     
* A repository for a C refresher can be found [here](https://github.com/drnobodyphd/C_basics)

*Note: If you plan on writing code for other classes (Comp Sci, Robotics, Embedded Systems, RTOS, Senior Projects, etc), it is encouraged you setup your own github account.  It is a requirement for lab.  It is widely used in industry.  You can watch youtube videos on how to use it.*
